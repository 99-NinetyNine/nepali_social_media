🚀 Building the Future of Social Media

During the COVID lockdown, I started building my first social media platform as a hobby project. Eventually, I had to pause it when college resumed — but now, with recent platform bans happening worldwide, I decided to rebuild it from scratch.

This time, I'm going bigger and better:

✅ All-in-one platform — Facebook + LinkedIn + Instagram + YouTube features  
✅ Completely open-source — Anyone can contribute and help shape the future  
✅ Built with Python + Django — Modern, scalable architecture  
✅ Sustainable funding — Ad revenue and premium subscriptions  
✅ Revenue sharing — Contributors get paid for their work  

Instead of scattered individual projects, imagine what we could build together. When platforms can be banned overnight, we need alternatives we control ourselves.
